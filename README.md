Bioacoustic classification using constrastive loss

This is an example exhibiting contrastive loss based metric learning for bioacoustic classification.
Code example classifies 40 classes, Mel-spectrograms are stored in 40 different folders titled S1-40. 

This example only uses 4 examples per class for training metric learning. 

Embeddings extracted from base network are used as the feature representation for training an MLP.
